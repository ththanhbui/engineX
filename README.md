# EngineX
A very simple implementation of **Tank 1990**

**Tank 1990** was a famous game. Here I aimed to implement a very simple version of it in Java, re-writing the engine all in Java based on **Unity**'s engine.

To play this game, run (in Java) the file GameApplication.java in /src/engine/ with **JOML** - an external jar library that can be found [here](https://github.com/ttb29/JOML)

- press *Left mouse* to shoot
- press 1 2 3 4 to change color
- press a s w d to move
- Bombs help to explode and kill the enemy
- Once you run out of HP, game over!

Enjoy!
